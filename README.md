# rabbitmq-cluster

Rabbitmq Cluster using Docker

## Status
In development.

## Note for SSH
It has SSH enabled with keys obtained from repository. Ideally, we should not 
require ssh access for docker containers. However, it helps to troubleshoot the
problem on the server. Once the status moves out of development, the ssh access
will be removed.
